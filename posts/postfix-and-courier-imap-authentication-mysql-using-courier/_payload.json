Courier IMAP connected straight up, without a hitch, but Postfix simply refused to. The case seemed to be (from reading online about it), that saslauthd's auxprop SQL driver doesn't like passwords being stored in an encrypted form. For modern software, this is absolutely absurd, if you ask me. Nevertheless, after multiple days tearing my hair out, I thought to myself \"Why am I using two different auth mechanisms?
