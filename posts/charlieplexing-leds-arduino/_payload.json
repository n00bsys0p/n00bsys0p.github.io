Other than the pin(s) set to INPUT mode, there will be two others, both set to OUTPUT. One of these will be set to LOW (the current sink), and the other will either be set to HIGH or a PWM value (the current source). Each combination of two different pins will cause one of two LEDs in the matrix to be lit, depending on which is the source and which is the sink.
