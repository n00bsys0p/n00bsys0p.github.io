Basically, I use the verbose mode, and carefully decide what I will and what I won't need. Slackware comes with about 15 of everything by default, so just limit it to one text editor, no office suite, ignore all X Windows based networking components etc... I tend to include everything in the /l folder, because it adds up to very little usage of space, but allows the addition of packages without too much hassle if necessary. Like I say... If you don't NEED it, don't install it. If you are a newbie to Slackware be particularly careful with the x/ folder, as you can b0rk it extremely easily...
