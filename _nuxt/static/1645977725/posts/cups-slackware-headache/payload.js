Not a very descriptive title I know, but one that describes exactly how I've been feeling for the last couple of days. I've been fighting with CUPS on one of my servers.

Apparently entering your root password into the CUPS web interface doesn't give you root permissions, it just allows you to access the admin features of the GUI. Here was my misunderstanding...
