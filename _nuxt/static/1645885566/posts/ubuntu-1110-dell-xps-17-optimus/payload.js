For some reason, the machine was crashing and hanging very soon after the beginning of the boot process. After a little investigation, I found that this was something to do with the nouveau driver trying to use KMS to set the video mode. In order to initially boot up, it was necessary to temporarily disable kernel modesetting. This can be done via the normal Ubuntu CD boot menu. When the accessibility icon appears at the bottom of the screen, press any key to enter the boot menu. Now press "},{type:b,tag:g,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:p}]},{type:a,value:" to see a drop down menu of commonly used kernel options (as shown in the image above).
